I don't remember what the first horror film I saw was. By the time I was 10 I was already well-versed in classic slashers, and had a VHS collection filled with _Nightmares_ and _Hellraisers_ and _Halloweens_.  I've never bothered to ask my mum why she let me watch them - even encouraged it by renting them for me from the tiny Blockbuster section in the SPAR at the end of our road and letting me copy them tape-to-tape. I don't really care.

What I do remember is the first film that scared me, because it's the only one that's ever done it. I think my lifelong obsession with horror has been a vain attempt to chase that original, traumatising high.

The film that did it isn't even a horror film. Not really. It's Nicolas Roeg's _The Witches_  (1990). I don't remember when I saw it, but it was either on VHS or on TV and so that probably means it was '91 or '92. I would have been 5 or 6 years old, and I remember being terrified of Anjelica Huston's make-up and supremely upset by the kids being turned into mice.

The name of this blog, _Poisoned Sweets_, comes from that film. This is a place for me to share writing about my favourite and most enduring passion. Exactly what form that's going to take remains to be seen.

Welcome to Poisoned Sweets. Thanks for joining me.
