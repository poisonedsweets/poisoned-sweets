I don't remember what the first horror film I saw was. By the time I was 10 I was
already well-versed in classic slashers, and had a VHS collection filled with _Nightmares_
and _Hellraisers_ and _Halloweens_.  I've never bothered to ask my mum why she let me
watch them - even encouraged it by renting them for me from the tiny Blockbuster section
in the SPAR at the end of our road and letting me copy them tape-to-tape. I don't really care.

What I do remember is the first film that scared me, because it's the only one that's ever done it.
I think my lifelong obsession with horror has been a vain attempt to chase that original,
traumatising high.

The film that did it isn't even a horror film. Not really. It's Nicolas Roeg's _The Witches_
(1990). I don't remember when I saw it, but it was either on VHS or on TV and so that
probably means it was '91 or '92. I would have been 5 or 6 years old, and I remember
being terrified of Anjelica Huston's make-up and supremely upset by the kids being turned into mice.

The name of this blog, _Poisoned Sweets_, comes from that film. This is a place for me to share
writing about my favourite and most enduring passion. Exactly what form that's going to take
remains to be seen.
