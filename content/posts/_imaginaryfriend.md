*We can swallow our fear or let our fear swallow us.*

*Single mother Kate Reese is on the run. Determined to improve life for her and her son, Christopher, she flees an abusive relationship in the middle of the night with Christopher at her side. Together, they find themselves drawn to the tight-knit community of Mill Grove, Pennsylvania. It's as far off the beaten track as they can get. Just one highway in, one highway out.*

*At first, it seems like the perfect place to finally settle down. Then Christopher vanishes. For six awful days, no one can find him. Until Christopher emerges from the woods at the edge of town, unharmed but not unchanged. He returns with a voice in his head only he can hear, with a mission only he can complete: Build a tree house in the woods by Christmas, or his mother and everyone in the town will never be the same again.*

*Soon Kate and Christopher find themselves in the fight of their lives, caught in the middle of a war playing out between good and evil, with their small town as the battleground.*

*Christopher is seven years old. Christopher is the new kid in town. Christopher has an imaginary friend. The epic work of literary horror from the #1 bestselling author of THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER.*

It's so hard to know what to say about this book. I've never fallen in love with a book so quickly only to begin to absolutely loathe it and wish it was over at literally the 50% mark.

*Imaginary Friend* owes a hell of a lot to Stephen King, for better and for worse. The first half is a great example of the way King begins to spin an epic story. We get a sense of this small town and all the various pressures brooding inside it, a compelling cast of characters being pulled in opposing directions, and a central supernatural mystery that we're slowly drip-fed answers to. At it's best it's reminiscent of *Pet Sematary, Lisey's Story*, and very much *IT*. There are also shades of Neil Gaiman's *The Ocean At The End Of The Lane*.

Unfortunately Chbosky completely fails to deliver on this strong start. If King is famous for occasionally writing himself into a corner and letting things fall apart at the end, Chbosky takes this to entirely new levels. The denouement is an incoherent mess, and I found myself eyeing the % marker on my Kindle begging the numbers to rise faster so that I could finally be done with it all.

I have problems with some big plot holes and the way that some elements are resolved but I'm not going to delve into them here because we'll be here all day. Suffice it to say that I finished this book very disappointed and relieved that it was finally over, and the only impression it left on me was that I want to go and reread some of my favourite King novels to get the taste out of my mouth.

**Verdict:** The first half is very compelling but I can't recommend this.
