Over the weekend of October 19th to 22nd Sheffield's Showroom Cinema hosted the 15th Anniversary edition of [Celluloid Screams](https://www.celluloidscreams.com). This was my first year attending but it definitely won't be the last. The line-up of films was great and I really loved seeing a mixture of new horror and old classics, and the midnight 35mm grindhouse screening (more on that in a minute) was a real treat. 

The choice to screen short films in front of features rather than in a big chunk at the start of the day like at [Grimmfest](https://poisoned-sweets.netlify.app/posts/_grimmfest2023/) is a really good one - and I say that as someone who looks forward to the short films programme at Grimm every year. It was especially fun trying to guess what the secret films might be based on the shorts that were being screened with them, though I was entirely wrong in all my guesses.

There were a couple of repeats from Grimmfest that I'd already seen among both the shorts and the features, and I chose to skip [Pandemonium](https://letterboxd.com/film/pandemonium-2023/) since I didn't really care for it the first time around. I also chose to skip the live director's commentary of [Turbo Kid](https://letterboxd.com/film/turbo-kid/crew/) that replaced the postponed Adam Buxton event. Other than that I was seated for the entire weekend. 

Here are some highlights. As with my Grimmfest post, spoilers ahead.

# The Shorts

## Gnomes! 

*Dir. Ruwan Heggelman*  
*[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/film/gnomes-2022/crew/)*

The story here is pretty simple - a runner strays into the territory of some gnomes, triggers one of their alarms, and is violently kidnapped and pulled apart for food.

It's both hilarious and very upsetting, and this is one of the most fucked up things I've ever seen (in a good way). The gnomes and their weird Rube Goldberg-esque contraptions are all stop motion animated in a way that's uncanny and weird in all the right ways, and the practical effects when they interact with the human lead are incredible. The violence feels brutal and very real, and you'll feel every impact and puncture.

There's one moment that mirrors a scene from Gulliver's Travels where Gulliver is tied down by the Lilliputians, and in this context it's utterly horrifying. I had the biggest grin on my face throughout the ~6 minute run time, and I immediately wanted to watch it again. Thankfully I hear there's a feature in the works, and I'll absolutely be seated for that.

## The Wyrm of Bwlch Pen Barras

I don't think you could make something more laser-targeted at me than "slow burn Cymraeg-language folk horror based on the Mabinogion", so this short was top of my "most anticipated" list going into the festival. I'm very happy to report that it definitely landed for me.

This is a long one, pushing 20 minutes of runtime, and it's a pretty slow burn. Thankfully it makes good use of its time, slowly unravelling the mystery of what's going on in this valley.

It's not perfect by any means - there's a fight scene that feels quite amateur, and the ending drops the ball a little by not giving us enough of an answer to what's going on (though of course the answer lives in the title of the film). It feels like a film deeply rooted in community and tradition, and so it would be nice to see how the events that transpire ripple out to affect the people impacted by them. But that's a big ask for a short, and it really makes my main complaint about the film "I wish this was a feature with a corresponding budget".

They're small complaints, really. I loved this and I've been thinking about it since the end credits rolled.

## Every House Is Haunted

*Dir. Bryce McGuire*  
*[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/film/every-house-is-haunted-2023/)*

![Every House Is Haunted](/images/_haunted.jpg)

A really unique haunted house story, where the characters being haunted have actively chosen that and are happy about it. This had something of the tone of quirky indie rom-dramas from the early 2010s like *Safety Not Guaranteed* or *Stranger Than Fiction* in a way that I can't quite pin down but that I really enjoyed.

The horror here comes in the final moments, in a move that has the potential to be corny but works really well. The question of "why don't the ghosts leave the house?" is a good one that I haven't seen explored enough in horror, and *Every House Is Haunted* has left me with a craving for that specific story to be told in a longer format.

# The Features

## Lady Terminator (1989)

*Dir. H. Tjut Djalil*  
*[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/film/lady-terminator/)*

![Lady Terminator](/images/_ladyt.jpg)

Okay, look. This film is objectively terrible. It's absolutely garbage. It's the shittiest of B-movies and there's a reason nobody has ever heard of it.

The film itself is instantly forgettable and doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. It starts off as a weird wannabe-erotic supernatural thriller and ends up as a shitty action film with tanks, missiles, and an indestructible woman in a leather jacket stealing lines from Terminator. This is very much the DNA that films like Sharktopus are built from. 

What puts this on my highlights list was the whole experience of watching it. It was shown as a midnight "Mystery Grindhouse 35mm" screening and everything about it was a delight, from not knowing what the film was going to be, to the fun that accompanies any sort of midnight viewing, to seeing weird 1980s cigarette adverts and having the reel snap partway through, and having a (quite drunk) audience whooping and hollering at the screen during the film. 

I also made a list of all the films we saw trailers for ahead of this, and I may make it a project to watch all of them. They were:

* [Halloween 3: Season Of The Witch](https://letterboxd.com/film/halloween-iii-season-of-the-witch/)
* [Starcrash](https://letterboxd.com/film/starcrash/)
* [Escape From Women's Prison](https://letterboxd.com/film/jailbirds-1978/)
* [Fräuleins in Uniforms](https://letterboxd.com/film/she-devils-of-the-ss/)
* [Enter The Dragon](https://letterboxd.com/film/enter-the-dragon/)
* [Fear No Evil](https://letterboxd.com/film/fear-no-evil/) 
* [Man's Best Friend](https://letterboxd.com/film/mans-best-friend-1993/trailer/)
* [Godzilla 2000](https://letterboxd.com/film/godzilla-2000-millennium/)
* [Amityville 2: The Possession](https://letterboxd.com/film/amityville-ii-the-possession/)
* [Flash Gordon](https://letterboxd.com/film/flash-gordon-1980/)

I have no idea where this reel came from or how these trailers from close to 30 years of cinema ended up next to one another one it, but I'm very glad we got to see it. If you want to save this list on Letterboxd for some reason, [you can do that](https://letterboxd.com/chrisdeadthrone/list/lady-terminator-trailers/).

## Falling Stars (2023)

*Dir. Richard Karpala, Gabriel Bienczycki*  
*[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/film/falling-stars-2023/)*

![Falling Stars](/images/_fallingstars.jpg)

This immediately became one of my favourite films. We're placed into a world where falling stars are actually witches, who fall to earth every year to harvest humans. Three brothers drive out into the desert to see a witch that their friend buried in the dirt a year earlier, and from there everything starts to go wrong.

It's quiet and introspective, with a solid emotional core carried by stunning, understated performances from the three lead actors (especially Rene Leech, who channels some of the same quiet energy as Paul Dano in *Little Miss Sunshine*) and a scene-stealing appearance from Diane Worman as their mother. 

The film takes what could be a very silly concept and treats it deadly seriously, building a world that we understand and believe and start to fear immediately. If I have one slight criticism it's that the couple of scenes that cut away from the core cast to a radio DJ seem superfluous and like they only exist to pad out the runtime to 80 minutes. I would much rather have spent 20 more minutes with the main story, especially as one of those cutaways takes place in the buildup to the climax of the film and robs those final scenes of some very carefully constructed energy.

That said, though, I adored this.

## Where The Devil Roams (2023)

*Dir. Toby Poser, John Adams, Zelda Adams*  
*[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/film/where-the-devil-roams/)*

![Where The Devil Roams](/images/_devil.png)

I knew I was going to love this because I love everything that the Adams family makes, and I wasn't at all disappointed. This time they take us into the weird world of American sideshows, channeling Ray Bradbury and *Carnivàle* in a depression-era gothic tale of dark magic, sacrifice, and the ends that obsession can lead us to.

It's very much a fever dream, letting plot and story fall by the wayside in places to lull us into a trance-like fugue state where we just have to let the weird events unfolding wash over us. It won't be for everyone, especially in the middle of a second act that starts to lag in places, but it more than makes up for that by the end. The closing sequences are nothing short of stunning, and the final shot leaves you asking "did I actually just see that?"

It's not often that I want a prequel to a film, but I really want to learn more about Mr. Tips and where he got that heart from.

## Stopmotion (2023)

*Dir. Robert Morgan*  
*[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/film/stopmotion/)*

![Stopmotion](/images/_stopmotion.jpg)

This has been on my radar since reviews started coming in from Fantastic Fest and I was very, very happy to find that this was the first secret film at Celluloid.

Stories about weirdly niche parts of filmmaking are some of my favourites (see [Censor](https://letterboxd.com/film/censor-2021/) and [Berberian Sound Studio](https://letterboxd.com/film/berberian-sound-studio/)) and Stopmotion sits neatly alongside them. The animation here is stunning and the way it sits alongside the human actors is deeply uncanny and unsettling. One sequence in particular, where Wax Girl crawls up the bed that Ella is sleeping on and starts cutting into her leg, is one of the most skin-crawling moments I've ever seen in a horror film.

For me as a person who makes a living from creative work the true horror of this film isn't in the physical events depicted on screen but in the uncomfortable, too-close-to-home things *Stopmotion* has to say about the often all-consuming obsession that comes along with artistic pursuits, and the sacrifices we have to make in order to profit from our passions. This one is going to stay with me for a while.

## The Chapel (2023)

*Dir. Carlota Pereda*  
*[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/film/berberian-sound-studio/)*

![The Chapel](/images/_chapel.jpg)

*[Piggy](https://letterboxd.com/film/piggy-2022/)* was one of my highlights from Grimmfest 2022, so I was very excited to see Pereda's new film and wasn't disappointed in any way.

At it's heart this is a coming of age story, a film about a young girl trying to come to terms with the loss of her mother and to find a way to hold on to her memory as she takes her own place in the world. The world feels big and magical and scary while also feeling small, tight-knit, at once the comfort of a warm blanket and the choking, smothering claustrophobia of a shroud.

As with *Piggy*, Pereda excels at building her films around communities. While her debut was focused on a girl who felt seen in all the wrong ways, pushed out and ostracised, *The Chapel* focuses on a girl who is being protected by those around her but who kicks out against them out of fear and pain. Maia Zaitegi is perfectly cast as Emma, delivering one of the best child performances I've seen in a long time, and the cast who support her do an incredible job of letting her shine.

I would have liked to see this delve a little deeper into the supernatural aspects of the story, to really get into the horror that's largely only hinted at, but to focus on that is to miss the larger point of the film. While there is a supernatural threat here the horror on display is the much more mundane fear of loss, abandonment, and being forced to find your way in the world at too early an age, and it never loses site of that. This is a really special film and I very much look forward to watching it again and again.
